Learning tutorial

I know basic to intermediate HTML and CSS.
Have taken classes to learn intermediate to advanced JAVA programming and SQL database.
I'm a fast learner, which is great, but have it's downsides, as I tend to grow bored quite easily, quite fast. But with programming that wasn't the case.

I'm going to make an android app with my sister, for her University studies.
